*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*>    ZLAVHP  performs one of the matrix-vector operations
*>       x := A*x  or  x := A^H*x,
*>    where x is an N element vector and  A is one of the factors
*>    from the symmetric factorization computed by ZHPTRF.
*>    ZHPTRF produces a factorization of the form
*>         U * D * U^H     or     L * D * L^H,
*>    where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*>    triangular matrices, U^H (or L^H) is the conjugate transpose of
*>    U (or L), and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with 1 x 1 and
*>    2 x 2 diagonal blocks.  The multipliers for the transformations
*>    and the upper or lower triangular parts of the diagonal blocks
*>    are stored columnwise in packed format in the linear array A.
*>
*>    If TRANS = 'N' or 'n', ZLAVHP multiplies either by U or U * D
*>    (or L or L * D).
*>    If TRANS = 'C' or 'c', ZLAVHP multiplies either by U^H or D * U^H
*>    (or L^H or D * L^H ).

*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \verbatim
*>  UPLO   - CHARACTER*1
*>           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the triangular matrix
*>           stored in A is upper or lower triangular.
*>              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   The matrix is upper triangular.
*>              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   The matrix is lower triangular.
*>           Unchanged on exit.
*>
*>  TRANS  - CHARACTER*1
*>           On entry, TRANS specifies the operation to be performed as
*>           follows:
*>              TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   x := A*x.
*>              TRANS = 'C' or 'c'   x := A^H*x.
*>           Unchanged on exit.
*>
*>  DIAG   - CHARACTER*1
*>           On entry, DIAG specifies whether the diagonal blocks are
*>           assumed to be unit matrices, as follows:
*>              DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   Diagonal blocks are unit matrices.
*>              DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   Diagonal blocks are non-unit.
*>           Unchanged on exit.
*>
*>  N      - INTEGER
*>           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
*>           N must be at least zero.
*>           Unchanged on exit.
*>
*>  NRHS   - INTEGER
*>           On entry, NRHS specifies the number of right hand sides,
*>           i.e., the number of vectors x to be multiplied by A.
*>           NRHS must be at least zero.
*>           Unchanged on exit.
*>
*>  A      - COMPLEX*16 array, dimension( N*(N+1)/2 )
*>           On entry, A contains a block diagonal matrix and the
*>           multipliers of the transformations used to obtain it,
*>           stored as a packed triangular matrix.
*>           Unchanged on exit.
*>
*>  IPIV   - INTEGER array, dimension( N )
*>           On entry, IPIV contains the vector of pivot indices as
*>           determined by ZSPTRF or ZHPTRF.
*>           If IPIV( K ) = K, no interchange was done.
*>           If IPIV( K ) <> K but IPIV( K ) > 0, then row K was inter-
*>           changed with row IPIV( K ) and a 1 x 1 pivot block was used.
*>           If IPIV( K ) < 0 and UPLO = 'U', then row K-1 was exchanged
*>           with row | IPIV( K ) | and a 2 x 2 pivot block was used.
*>           If IPIV( K ) < 0 and UPLO = 'L', then row K+1 was exchanged
*>           with row | IPIV( K ) | and a 2 x 2 pivot block was used.
*>
*>  B      - COMPLEX*16 array, dimension( LDB, NRHS )
*>           On entry, B contains NRHS vectors of length N.
*>           On exit, B is overwritten with the product A * B.
*>
*>  LDB    - INTEGER
*>           On entry, LDB contains the leading dimension of B as
*>           declared in the calling program.  LDB must be at least
*>           max( 1, N ).
*>           Unchanged on exit.
*>
*>  INFO   - INTEGER
*>           INFO is the error flag.
*>           On exit, a value of 0 indicates a successful exit.
*>           A negative value, say -K, indicates that the K-th argument
*>           has an illegal value.
