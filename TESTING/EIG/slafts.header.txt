*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*>    SLAFTS tests the result vector against the threshold value to
*>    see which tests for this matrix type failed to pass the threshold.
*>    Output is to the file given by unit IOUNIT.

*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \verbatim
*>  TYPE   - CHARACTER*3
*>           On entry, TYPE specifies the matrix type to be used in the
*>           printed messages.
*>           Not modified.
*>
*>  N      - INTEGER
*>           On entry, N specifies the order of the test matrix.
*>           Not modified.
*>
*>  IMAT   - INTEGER
*>           On entry, IMAT specifies the type of the test matrix.
*>           A listing of the different types is printed by SLAHD2
*>           to the output file if a test fails to pass the threshold.
*>           Not modified.
*>
*>  NTESTS - INTEGER
*>           On entry, NTESTS is the number of tests performed on the
*>           subroutines in the path given by TYPE.
*>           Not modified.
*>
*>  RESULT - REAL               array of dimension( NTESTS )
*>           On entry, RESULT contains the test ratios from the tests
*>           performed in the calling program.
*>           Not modified.
*>
*>  ISEED  - INTEGER            array of dimension( 4 )
*>           Contains the random seed that generated the matrix used
*>           for the tests whose ratios are in RESULT.
*>           Not modified.
*>
*>  THRESH - REAL
*>           On entry, THRESH specifies the acceptable threshold of the
*>           test ratios.  If RESULT( K ) > THRESH, then the K-th test
*>           did not pass the threshold and a message will be printed.
*>           Not modified.
*>
*>  IOUNIT - INTEGER
*>           On entry, IOUNIT specifies the unit number of the file
*>           to which the messages are printed.
*>           Not modified.
*>
*>  IE     - INTEGER
*>           On entry, IE contains the number of tests which have
*>           failed to pass the threshold so far.
*>           Updated on exit if any of the ratios in RESULT also fail.
