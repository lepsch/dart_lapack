!   This is a test program for checking the implementations of
!   the implementations of the following subroutines
!
!   CGEDMD,  for computation of the
!            Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)
!   CGEDMDQ, for computation of a
!            QR factorization based compressed DMD
!
!   Developed and supported by:
!   ===========================
!   Developed and coded by Zlatko Drmac, Faculty of Science,
!   University of Zagreb;  drmac@math.hr
!   In cooperation with
!   AIMdyn Inc., Santa Barbara, CA.
!   ========================================================
!   How to run the code (compiler, link info)
!   ========================================================
!   Compile as FORTRAN 90 (or later) and link with BLAS and
!   LAPACK libraries.
!   NOTE: The code is developed and tested on top of the
!   Intel MKL library (versions 2022.0.3 and 2022.2.0),
!   using the Intel Fortran compiler.
!
!   For developers of the C++ implementation
!   ========================================================
!   See the LAPACK++ and Template Numerical Toolkit (TNT)
!
!   Note on a development of the GPU HP implementation
!   ========================================================
!   Work in progress. See CUDA, MAGMA, SLATE.
!   NOTE: The four SVD subroutines used in this code are
!   included as a part of R&D and for the completeness.
!   This was also an opportunity to test those SVD codes.
!   If the scaling option is used all four are essentially
!   equally good. For implementations on HP platforms,
!   one can use whichever SVD is available.
