*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> CLATRD reduces NB rows and columns of a complex Hermitian matrix A to
*> Hermitian tridiagonal form by a unitary similarity
*> transformation Q**H * A * Q, and returns the matrices V and W which are
*> needed to apply the transformation to the unreduced part of A.
*>
*> If UPLO = 'U', CLATRD reduces the last NB rows and columns of a
*> matrix, of which the upper triangle is supplied;
*> if UPLO = 'L', CLATRD reduces the first NB rows and columns of a
*> matrix, of which the lower triangle is supplied.
*>
*> This is an auxiliary routine called by CHETRD.

*
*> \param[in] UPLO
*> \verbatim
*>          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
*>          Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
*>          Hermitian matrix A is stored:
*>          = 'U': Upper triangular
*>          = 'L': Lower triangular
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER

*>
*> \param[in] NB
*> \verbatim
*>          NB is INTEGER
*>          The number of rows and columns to be reduced.

*>
*> \param[in,out] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
*>          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*>          n-by-n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*>          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*>          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*>          leading n-by-n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*>          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper

*>            tridiagonal form, with the diagonal elements overwriting
*>            the diagonal elements of A; the elements above the diagonal

*>          E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)

*>
*>  If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
*>  reflectors
*>
*>     Q = H(n) H(n-1) . . . H(n-nb+1).
*>
*>  Each H(i) has the form
*>
*>     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H
*>
*>  where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
*>  v(i:n) = 0 and v(i-1) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in A(1:i-1,i),
*>  and tau in TAU(i-1).
*>
*>  If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
*>  reflectors
*>
*>     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(nb).
*>
*>  Each H(i) has the form
*>
*>     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H
*>
*>  where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
*>  v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+1:n) is stored on exit in A(i+1:n,i),
*>  and tau in TAU(i).
*>
*>  The elements of the vectors v together form the n-by-nb matrix V
*>  which is needed, with W, to apply the transformation to the unreduced
*>  part of the matrix, using a Hermitian rank-2k update of the form:
*>  A := A - V*W**H - W*V**H.
*>
*>  The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples
*>  with n = 5 and nb = 2:
*>
*>  if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':
*>
*>    (  a   a   a   v4  v5 )              (  d                  )
*>    (      a   a   v4  v5 )              (  1   d              )
*>    (          a   1   v5 )              (  v1  1   a          )
*>    (              d   1  )              (  v1  v2  a   a      )
*>    (                  d  )              (  v1  v2  a   a   a  )
*>
*>  where d denotes a diagonal element of the reduced matrix, a denotes
*>  an element of the original matrix that is unchanged, and vi denotes
*>  an element of the vector defining H(i).
