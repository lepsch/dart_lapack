*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> CTRSV  solves one of the systems of equations
*>
*>    A*x = b,   or   A**T*x = b,   or   A**H*x = b,
*>
*> where b and x are n element vectors and A is an n by n unit, or
*> non-unit, upper or lower triangular matrix.
*>
*> No test for singularity or near-singularity is included in this
*> routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.
*> \endverbatim
*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] UPLO
*> \verbatim
*>          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
*>           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or
*>           lower triangular matrix as follows:
*>
*>              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.
*>
*>              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] TRANS
*> \verbatim
*>          TRANS is CHARACTER*1
*>           On entry, TRANS specifies the equations to be solved as
*>           follows:
*>
*>              TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   A*x = b.
*>
*>              TRANS = 'T' or 't'   A**T*x = b.
*>
*>              TRANS = 'C' or 'c'   A**H*x = b.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] DIAG
*> \verbatim
*>          DIAG is CHARACTER*1
*>           On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit
*>           triangular as follows:
*>
*>              DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   A is assumed to be unit triangular.
*>
*>              DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   A is not assumed to be unit
*>                                  triangular.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
*>           N must be at least zero.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is COMPLEX array, dimension ( LDA, N )
*>           Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n
*>           upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper
*>           triangular matrix and the strictly lower triangular part of
*>           A is not referenced.
*>           Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n
*>           lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower
*>           triangular matrix and the strictly upper triangular part of
*>           A is not referenced.
*>           Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u', the diagonal elements of
*>           A are not referenced either, but are assumed to be unity.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDA
*> \verbatim
*>          LDA is INTEGER
*>           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
*>           in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
*>           max( 1, n ).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] X
*> \verbatim
*>          X is COMPLEX array, dimension at least
*>           ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
*>           Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
*>           element right-hand side vector b. On exit, X is overwritten
*>           with the solution vector x.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] INCX
*> \verbatim
*>          INCX is INTEGER
*>           On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
*>           X. INCX must not be zero.
