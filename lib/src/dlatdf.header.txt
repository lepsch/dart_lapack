*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> DLATDF uses the LU factorization of the n-by-n matrix Z computed by
*> DGETC2 and computes a contribution to the reciprocal Dif-estimate
*> by solving Z * x = b for x, and choosing the r.h.s. b such that
*> the norm of x is as large as possible. On entry RHS = b holds the
*> contribution from earlier solved sub-systems, and on return RHS = x.
*>
*> The factorization of Z returned by DGETC2 has the form Z = P*L*U*Q,
*> where P and Q are permutation matrices. L is lower triangular with
*> unit diagonal elements and U is upper triangular.

*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] IJOB
*> \verbatim
*>          IJOB is INTEGER
*>          IJOB = 2: First compute an approximative null-vector e
*>              of Z using DGECON, e is normalized and solve for
*>              Zx = +-e - f with the sign giving the greater value
*>              of 2-norm(x). About 5 times as expensive as Default.
*>          IJOB .ne. 2: Local look ahead strategy where all entries of
*>              the r.h.s. b is chosen as either +1 or -1 (Default).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>          The number of columns of the matrix Z.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] Z
*> \verbatim
*>          Z is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, N)
*>          On entry, the LU part of the factorization of the n-by-n
*>          matrix Z computed by DGETC2:  Z = P * L * U * Q
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDZ
*> \verbatim
*>          LDZ is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDA >= max(1, N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] RHS
*> \verbatim
*>          RHS is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*>          On entry, RHS contains contributions from other subsystems.
*>          On exit, RHS contains the solution of the subsystem with
*>          entries according to the value of IJOB (see above).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] RDSUM
*> \verbatim
*>          RDSUM is DOUBLE PRECISION
*>          On entry, the sum of squares of computed contributions to
*>          the Dif-estimate under computation by DTGSYL, where the
*>          scaling factor RDSCAL (see below) has been factored out.
*>          On exit, the corresponding sum of squares updated with the
*>          contributions from the current sub-system.
*>          If TRANS = 'T' RDSUM is not touched.
*>          NOTE: RDSUM only makes sense when DTGSY2 is called by STGSYL.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] RDSCAL
*> \verbatim
*>          RDSCAL is DOUBLE PRECISION
*>          On entry, scaling factor used to prevent overflow in RDSUM.
*>          On exit, RDSCAL is updated w.r.t. the current contributions
*>          in RDSUM.
*>          If TRANS = 'T', RDSCAL is not touched.
*>          NOTE: RDSCAL only makes sense when DTGSY2 is called by
*>                DTGSYL.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] IPIV
*> \verbatim
*>          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N).
*>          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the
*>          matrix has been interchanged with row IPIV(i).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] JPIV
*> \verbatim
*>          JPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N).
*>          The pivot indices; for 1 <= j <= N, column j of the
*>          matrix has been interchanged with column JPIV(j).
