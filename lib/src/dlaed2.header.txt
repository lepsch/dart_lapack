*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> DLAED2 merges the two sets of eigenvalues together into a single
*> sorted set.  Then it tries to deflate the size of the problem.
*> There are two ways in which deflation can occur:  when two or more
*> eigenvalues are close together or if there is a tiny entry in the
*> Z vector.  For each such occurrence the order of the related secular
*> equation problem is reduced by one.
*> \endverbatim
*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[out] K
*> \verbatim
*>          K is INTEGER
*>         The number of non-deflated eigenvalues, and the order of the
*>         related secular equation. 0 <= K <=N.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>         The dimension of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix.  N >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N1
*> \verbatim
*>          N1 is INTEGER
*>         The location of the last eigenvalue in the leading sub-matrix.
*>         min(1,N) <= N1 <= N/2.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] D
*> \verbatim
*>          D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*>         On entry, D contains the eigenvalues of the two submatrices to
*>         be combined.
*>         On exit, D contains the trailing (N-K) updated eigenvalues
*>         (those which were deflated) sorted into increasing order.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] Q
*> \verbatim
*>          Q is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDQ, N)
*>         On entry, Q contains the eigenvectors of two submatrices in
*>         the two square blocks with corners at (1,1), (N1,N1)
*>         and (N1+1, N1+1), (N,N).
*>         On exit, Q contains the trailing (N-K) updated eigenvectors
*>         (those which were deflated) in its last N-K columns.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDQ
*> \verbatim
*>          LDQ is INTEGER
*>         The leading dimension of the array Q.  LDQ >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] INDXQ
*> \verbatim
*>          INDXQ is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>         The permutation which separately sorts the two sub-problems
*>         in D into ascending order.  Note that elements in the second
*>         half of this permutation must first have N1 added to their
*>         values. Destroyed on exit.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] RHO
*> \verbatim
*>          RHO is DOUBLE PRECISION
*>         On entry, the off-diagonal element associated with the rank-1
*>         cut which originally split the two submatrices which are now
*>         being recombined.
*>         On exit, RHO has been modified to the value required by
*>         DLAED3.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] Z
*> \verbatim
*>          Z is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*>         On entry, Z contains the updating vector (the last
*>         row of the first sub-eigenvector matrix and the first row of
*>         the second sub-eigenvector matrix).
*>         On exit, the contents of Z have been destroyed by the updating
*>         process.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] DLAMBDA
*> \verbatim
*>          DLAMBDA is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*>         A copy of the first K eigenvalues which will be used by
*>         DLAED3 to form the secular equation.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] W
*> \verbatim
*>          W is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*>         The first k values of the final deflation-altered z-vector
*>         which will be passed to DLAED3.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] Q2
*> \verbatim
*>          Q2 is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N1**2+(N-N1)**2)
*>         A copy of the first K eigenvectors which will be used by
*>         DLAED3 in a matrix multiply (DGEMM) to solve for the new
*>         eigenvectors.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] INDX
*> \verbatim
*>          INDX is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>         The permutation used to sort the contents of DLAMBDA into
*>         ascending order.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] INDXC
*> \verbatim
*>          INDXC is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>         The permutation used to arrange the columns of the deflated
*>         Q matrix into three groups:  the first group contains non-zero
*>         elements only at and above N1, the second contains
*>         non-zero elements only below N1, and the third is dense.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] INDXP
*> \verbatim
*>          INDXP is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>         The permutation used to place deflated values of D at the end
*>         of the array.  INDXP(1:K) points to the nondeflated D-values
*>         and INDXP(K+1:N) points to the deflated eigenvalues.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] COLTYP
*> \verbatim
*>          COLTYP is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>         During execution, a label which will indicate which of the
*>         following types a column in the Q2 matrix is:
*>         1 : non-zero in the upper half only;
*>         2 : dense;
*>         3 : non-zero in the lower half only;
*>         4 : deflated.
*>         On exit, COLTYP(i) is the number of columns of type i,
*>         for i=1 to 4 only.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] INFO
*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>          = 0:  successful exit.
*>          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
