*> ZSYTF2_RK computes the factorization of a complex symmetric matrix A
*> using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman (rook) diagonal pivoting method:
*>
*>    A = P*U*D*(U**T)*(P**T) or A = P*L*D*(L**T)*(P**T),
*>
*> where U (or L) is unit upper (or lower) triangular matrix,

*> \param[in] UPLO
*> \verbatim
*>          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
*>          Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
*>          symmetric matrix A is stored:
*>          = 'U':  Upper triangular
*>          = 'L':  Lower triangular
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

*>
*> \param[in,out] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*>          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.
*>            If UPLO = 'U': the leading N-by-N upper triangular part
*>            of A contains the upper triangular part of the matrix A,
*>            and the strictly lower triangular part of A is not

*>
*>            If UPLO = 'L': the leading N-by-N lower triangular part
*>            of A contains the lower triangular part of the matrix A,

*>
*>          On exit, contains:
*>            a) ONLY diagonal elements of the symmetric block diagonal
*>               matrix D on the diagonal of A, i.e. D(k,k) = A(k,k);
*>               (superdiagonal (or subdiagonal) elements of D
*>                are stored on exit in array E), and

*>               If UPLO = 'L': factor L in the subdiagonal part of A.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDA
*> \verbatim
*>          LDA is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] E
*> \verbatim
*>          E is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N)
*>          On exit, contains the superdiagonal (or subdiagonal)
*>          elements of the symmetric block diagonal matrix D
*>          with 1-by-1 or 2-by-2 diagonal blocks, where
*>          If UPLO = 'U': E(i) = D(i-1,i), i=2:N, E(1) is set to 0;
*>          If UPLO = 'L': E(i) = D(i+1,i), i=1:N-1, E(N) is set to 0.
*>
*>          NOTE: For 1-by-1 diagonal block D(k), where
*>          1 <= k <= N, the element E(k) is set to 0 in both
*>          UPLO = 'U' or UPLO = 'L' cases.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] IPIV
*> \verbatim
*>          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>          IPIV describes the permutation matrix P in the factorization
*>          of matrix A as follows. The absolute value of IPIV(k)
*>          represents the index of row and column that were
*>          interchanged with the k-th row and column. The value of UPLO
*>          describes the order in which the interchanges were applied.
*>          Also, the sign of IPIV represents the block structure of
*>          the symmetric block diagonal matrix D with 1-by-1 or 2-by-2
*>          diagonal blocks which correspond to 1 or 2 interchanges
*>          at each factorization step. For more info see Further
*>          Details section.
*>
*>          If UPLO = 'U',
*>          ( in factorization order, k decreases from N to 1 ):
*>            a) A single positive entry IPIV(k) > 0 means:
*>               D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*>               If IPIV(k) != k, rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*>               interchanged in the matrix A(1:N,1:N);
*>               If IPIV(k) = k, no interchange occurred.
*>
*>            b) A pair of consecutive negative entries
*>               IPIV(k) < 0 and IPIV(k-1) < 0 means:
*>               D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*>               (NOTE: negative entries in IPIV appear ONLY in pairs).
*>               1) If -IPIV(k) != k, rows and columns
*>                  k and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
*>                  in the matrix A(1:N,1:N).
*>                  If -IPIV(k) = k, no interchange occurred.
*>               2) If -IPIV(k-1) != k-1, rows and columns
*>                  k-1 and -IPIV(k-1) were interchanged
*>                  in the matrix A(1:N,1:N).
*>                  If -IPIV(k-1) = k-1, no interchange occurred.
*>
*>            c) In both cases a) and b), always ABS( IPIV(k) ) <= k.
*>
*>            d) NOTE: Any entry IPIV(k) is always NONZERO on output.
*>
*>          If UPLO = 'L',
*>          ( in factorization order, k increases from 1 to N ):
*>            a) A single positive entry IPIV(k) > 0 means:
*>               D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*>               If IPIV(k) != k, rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*>               interchanged in the matrix A(1:N,1:N).
*>               If IPIV(k) = k, no interchange occurred.
*>
*>            b) A pair of consecutive negative entries
*>               IPIV(k) < 0 and IPIV(k+1) < 0 means:
*>               D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*>               (NOTE: negative entries in IPIV appear ONLY in pairs).
*>               1) If -IPIV(k) != k, rows and columns
*>                  k and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
*>                  in the matrix A(1:N,1:N).
*>                  If -IPIV(k) = k, no interchange occurred.
*>               2) If -IPIV(k+1) != k+1, rows and columns
*>                  k-1 and -IPIV(k-1) were interchanged
*>                  in the matrix A(1:N,1:N).
*>                  If -IPIV(k+1) = k+1, no interchange occurred.
*>
*>            c) In both cases a) and b), always ABS( IPIV(k) ) >= k.
*>
*>            d) NOTE: Any entry IPIV(k) is always NONZERO on output.

*>
*> \param[out] INFO
*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>          = 0: successful exit
*>
*>          < 0: If INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
*>
*>          > 0: If INFO = k, the matrix A is singular, because:
*>                 If UPLO = 'U': column k in the upper
*>                 triangular part of A contains all zeros.
*>                 If UPLO = 'L': column k in the lower
*>                 triangular part of A contains all zeros.
*>
*>               Therefore D(k,k) is exactly zero, and superdiagonal
*>               elements of column k of U (or subdiagonal elements of
*>               column k of L ) are all zeros. The factorization has
*>               been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
*>               exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if
*>               it is used to solve a system of equations.
*>
*>               NOTE: INFO only stores the first occurrence of
*>               a singularity, any subsequent occurrence of singularity
*>               is not stored in INFO even though the factorization
*>               always completes.
