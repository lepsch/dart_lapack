*> \verbatim
*>
*>  The input matrix C is a M-by-(M+N) matrix
*>
*>               C = [ A ] [ B ]
*>
*>
*>  where A is an lower triangular M-by-M matrix, and B is M-by-N pentagonal
*>  matrix consisting of a M-by-(N-L) rectangular matrix B1 on left of a M-by-L
*>  upper trapezoidal matrix B2:
*>          [ B ] = [ B1 ] [ B2 ]
*>                   [ B1 ]  <- M-by-(N-L) rectangular
*>                   [ B2 ]  <-     M-by-L lower trapezoidal.
*>
*>  The lower trapezoidal matrix B2 consists of the first L columns of a
*>  M-by-M lower triangular matrix, where 0 <= L <= MIN(M,N).  If L=0,
*>  B is rectangular M-by-N; if M=L=N, B is lower triangular.
*>
*>  The matrix W stores the elementary reflectors H(i) in the i-th row
*>  above the diagonal (of A) in the M-by-(M+N) input matrix C
*>            [ C ] = [ A ] [ B ]
*>                   [ A ]  <- lower triangular M-by-M
*>                   [ B ]  <- M-by-N pentagonal
*>
*>  so that W can be represented as
*>            [ W ] = [ I ] [ V ]
*>                   [ I ]  <- identity, M-by-M
*>                   [ V ]  <- M-by-N, same form as B.
*>
*>  Thus, all of information needed for W is contained on exit in B, which
*>  we call V above.  Note that V has the same form as B; that is,
*>            [ V ] = [ V1 ] [ V2 ]
*>                   [ V1 ] <- M-by-(N-L) rectangular
*>                   [ V2 ] <-     M-by-L lower trapezoidal.
*>
*>  The rows of V represent the vectors which define the H(i)'s.
*>
*>  The number of blocks is B = ceiling(M/MB), where each
*>  block is of order MB except for the last block, which is of order
*>  IB = M - (M-1)*MB.  For each of the B blocks, a upper triangular block
*>  reflector factor is computed: T1, T2, ..., TB.  The MB-by-MB (and IB-by-IB
*>  for the last block) T's are stored in the MB-by-N matrix T as
*>
*>               T = [T1 T2 ... TB].
