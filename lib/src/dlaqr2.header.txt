*>    DLAQR2 is identical to DLAQR3 except that it avoids
*>    recursion by calling DLAHQR instead of DLAQR4.
*>
*>    Aggressive early deflation:
*>
*>    This subroutine accepts as input an upper Hessenberg matrix
*>    H and performs an orthogonal similarity transformation
*>    designed to detect and deflate fully converged eigenvalues from
*>    a trailing principal submatrix.  On output H has been over-
*>    written by a new Hessenberg matrix that is a perturbation of
*>    an orthogonal similarity transformation of H.  It is to be
*>    hoped that the final version of H has many zero subdiagonal
*>    entries.

*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] WANTT
*> \verbatim
*>          WANTT is LOGICAL
*>          If .TRUE., then the Hessenberg matrix H is fully updated
*>          so that the quasi-triangular Schur factor may be
*>          computed (in cooperation with the calling subroutine).
*>          If .FALSE., then only enough of H is updated to preserve
*>          the eigenvalues.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] WANTZ
*> \verbatim
*>          WANTZ is LOGICAL
*>          If .TRUE., then the orthogonal matrix Z is updated so
*>          so that the orthogonal Schur factor may be computed
*>          (in cooperation with the calling subroutine).
*>          If .FALSE., then Z is not referenced.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>          The order of the matrix H and (if WANTZ is .TRUE.) the
*>          order of the orthogonal matrix Z.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] KTOP
*> \verbatim
*>          KTOP is INTEGER
*>          It is assumed that either KTOP = 1 or H(KTOP,KTOP-1)=0.
*>          KBOT and KTOP together determine an isolated block
*>          along the diagonal of the Hessenberg matrix.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] KBOT
*> \verbatim
*>          KBOT is INTEGER
*>          It is assumed without a check that either
*>          KBOT = N or H(KBOT+1,KBOT)=0.  KBOT and KTOP together
*>          determine an isolated block along the diagonal of the
*>          Hessenberg matrix.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NW
*> \verbatim
*>          NW is INTEGER
*>          Deflation window size.  1 <= NW <= (KBOT-KTOP+1).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] H
*> \verbatim
*>          H is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDH,N)
*>          On input the initial N-by-N section of H stores the
*>          Hessenberg matrix undergoing aggressive early deflation.
*>          On output H has been transformed by an orthogonal
*>          similarity transformation, perturbed, and the returned
*>          to Hessenberg form that (it is to be hoped) has some
*>          zero subdiagonal entries.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDH
*> \verbatim
*>          LDH is INTEGER
*>          Leading dimension of H just as declared in the calling

*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] ILOZ
*> \verbatim
*>          ILOZ is INTEGER
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] IHIZ
*> \verbatim
*>          IHIZ is INTEGER
*>          Specify the rows of Z to which transformations must be
*>          applied if WANTZ is .TRUE.. 1 <= ILOZ <= IHIZ <= N.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] Z
*> \verbatim
*>          Z is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ,N)
*>          IF WANTZ is .TRUE., then on output, the orthogonal
*>          similarity transformation mentioned above has been
*>          accumulated into Z(ILOZ:IHIZ,ILOZ:IHIZ) from the right.
*>          If WANTZ is .FALSE., then Z is unreferenced.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDZ
*> \verbatim

*>          returned in SR and SI that may be used as shifts by the
*>          calling subroutine.

*>          SI is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (KBOT)
*>          On output, the real and imaginary parts of approximate
*>          eigenvalues that may be used for shifts are stored in
*>          SR(KBOT-ND-NS+1) through SR(KBOT-ND) and
*>          SI(KBOT-ND-NS+1) through SI(KBOT-ND), respectively.

*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LWORK
*> \verbatim
*>          LWORK is INTEGER
*>          The dimension of the work array WORK.  LWORK = 2*NW
*>          suffices, but greater efficiency may result from larger
*>          values of LWORK.
*>
*>          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; DLAQR2
*>          only estimates the optimal workspace size for the given
*>          values of N, NW, KTOP and KBOT.  The estimate is returned
*>          in WORK(1).  No error message related to LWORK is issued
*>          by XERBLA.  Neither H nor Z are accessed.
