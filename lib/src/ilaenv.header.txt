*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> ILAENV is called from the LAPACK routines to choose problem-dependent
*> parameters for the local environment.  See ISPEC for a description of
*> the parameters.
*>
*> ILAENV returns an INTEGER
*> if ILAENV >= 0: ILAENV returns the value of the parameter specified by ISPEC
*> if ILAENV < 0:  if ILAENV = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value.
*>
*> This version provides a set of parameters which should give good,
*> but not optimal, performance on many of the currently available
*> computers.  Users are encouraged to modify this subroutine to set
*> the tuning parameters for their particular machine using the option
*> and problem size information in the arguments.
*>
*> This routine will not function correctly if it is converted to all
*> lower case.  Converting it to all upper case is allowed.
*> \endverbatim
*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] ISPEC
*> \verbatim
*>          ISPEC is INTEGER
*>          Specifies the parameter to be returned as the value of
*>          ILAENV.
*>          = 1: the optimal blocksize; if this value is 1, an unblocked
*>               algorithm will give the best performance.
*>          = 2: the minimum block size for which the block routine
*>               should be used; if the usable block size is less than
*>               this value, an unblocked routine should be used.
*>          = 3: the crossover point (in a block routine, for N less
*>               than this value, an unblocked routine should be used)
*>          = 4: the number of shifts, used in the nonsymmetric
*>               eigenvalue routines (DEPRECATED)
*>          = 5: the minimum column dimension for blocking to be used;
*>               rectangular blocks must have dimension at least k by m,
*>               where k is given by ILAENV(2,...) and m by ILAENV(5,...)
*>          = 6: the crossover point for the SVD (when reducing an m by n
*>               matrix to bidiagonal form, if max(m,n)/min(m,n) exceeds
*>               this value, a QR factorization is used first to reduce
*>               the matrix to a triangular form.)
*>          = 7: the number of processors
*>          = 8: the crossover point for the multishift QR method
*>               for nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems (DEPRECATED)
*>          = 9: maximum size of the subproblems at the bottom of the
*>               computation tree in the divide-and-conquer algorithm
*>               (used by xGELSD and xGESDD)
*>          =10: ieee infinity and NaN arithmetic can be trusted not to trap
*>          =11: infinity arithmetic can be trusted not to trap
*>          12 <= ISPEC <= 17:
*>               xHSEQR or related subroutines,
*>               see IPARMQ for detailed explanation
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NAME
*> \verbatim
*>          NAME is CHARACTER*(*)
*>          The name of the calling subroutine, in either upper case or
*>          lower case.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] OPTS
*> \verbatim
*>          OPTS is CHARACTER*(*)
*>          The character options to the subroutine NAME, concatenated
*>          into a single character string.  For example, UPLO = 'U',
*>          TRANS = 'T', and DIAG = 'N' for a triangular routine would
*>          be specified as OPTS = 'UTN'.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N1
*> \verbatim
*>          N1 is INTEGER
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N2
*> \verbatim
*>          N2 is INTEGER
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N3
*> \verbatim
*>          N3 is INTEGER
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N4
*> \verbatim
*>          N4 is INTEGER
*>          Problem dimensions for the subroutine NAME; these may not all
*>          be required.

*> \par Further Details:
*  =====================
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*>  The following conventions have been used when calling ILAENV from the
*>  LAPACK routines:
*>  1)  OPTS is a concatenation of all of the character options to
*>      subroutine NAME, in the same order that they appear in the
*>      argument list for NAME, even if they are not used in determining
*>      the value of the parameter specified by ISPEC.
*>  2)  The problem dimensions N1, N2, N3, N4 are specified in the order
*>      that they appear in the argument list for NAME.  N1 is used
*>      first, N2 second, and so on, and unused problem dimensions are
*>      passed a value of -1.
*>  3)  The parameter value returned by ILAENV is checked for validity in
*>      the calling subroutine.  For example, ILAENV is used to retrieve
*>      the optimal blocksize for STRTRI as follows:
*>
*>      NB = ILAENV( 1, 'STRTRI', UPLO // DIAG, N, -1, -1, -1 )
*>      IF( NB.LE.1 ) NB = MAX( 1, N )
*> \endverbatim
