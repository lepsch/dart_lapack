*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> ZCPOSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
*>    A * X = B,
*> where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite matrix and X and B
*> are N-by-NRHS matrices.
*>
*> ZCPOSV first attempts to factorize the matrix in COMPLEX and use this
*> factorization within an iterative refinement procedure to produce a
*> solution with COMPLEX*16 normwise backward error quality (see below).
*> If the approach fails the method switches to a COMPLEX*16
*> factorization and solve.
*>
*> The iterative refinement is not going to be a winning strategy if
*> the ratio COMPLEX performance over COMPLEX*16 performance is too
*> small. A reasonable strategy should take the number of right-hand
*> sides and the size of the matrix into account. This might be done
*> with a call to ILAENV in the future. Up to now, we always try
*> iterative refinement.
*>
*> The iterative refinement process is stopped if
*>     ITER > ITERMAX
*> or for all the RHS we have:
*>     RNRM < SQRT(N)*XNRM*ANRM*EPS*BWDMAX
*> where
*>     o ITER is the number of the current iteration in the iterative
*>       refinement process
*>     o RNRM is the infinity-norm of the residual
*>     o XNRM is the infinity-norm of the solution
*>     o ANRM is the infinity-operator-norm of the matrix A
*>     o EPS is the machine epsilon returned by DLAMCH('Epsilon')
*> The value ITERMAX and BWDMAX are fixed to 30 and 1.0D+00
*> respectively.

*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] UPLO
*> \verbatim
*>          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
*>          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*>          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>          The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
*>          matrix A.  N >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NRHS
*> \verbatim
*>          NRHS is INTEGER
*>          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
*>          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is COMPLEX*16 array,
*>          dimension (LDA,N)
*>          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A. If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*>          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*>          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*>          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*>          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*>          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*>          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*>
*>          Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal
*>          elements need not be set and are assumed to be zero.
*>
*>          On exit, if iterative refinement has been successfully used
*>          (INFO = 0 and ITER >= 0, see description below), then A is
*>          unchanged, if double precision factorization has been used
*>          (INFO = 0 and ITER < 0, see description below), then the
*>          array A contains the factor U or L from the Cholesky
*>          factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDA
*> \verbatim
*>          LDA is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] B
*> \verbatim

*>          The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] WORK
*> \verbatim
*>          WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N,NRHS)
*>          This array is used to hold the residual vectors.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] SWORK
*> \verbatim
*>          SWORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+NRHS))
*>          This array is used to use the single precision matrix and the
*>          right-hand sides or solutions in single precision.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] RWORK
*> \verbatim
*>          RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] ITER
*> \verbatim
*>          ITER is INTEGER
*>          < 0: iterative refinement has failed, COMPLEX*16
*>               factorization has been performed
*>               -1 : the routine fell back to full precision for
*>                    implementation- or machine-specific reasons
*>               -2 : narrowing the precision induced an overflow,
*>                    the routine fell back to full precision
*>               -3 : failure of CPOTRF
*>               -31: stop the iterative refinement after the 30th
*>                    iterations
*>          > 0: iterative refinement has been successfully used.
*>               Returns the number of iterations

*> \param[out] INFO
*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>          = 0:  successful exit
*>          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*>          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading principal minor of order i
*>                of (COMPLEX*16) A is not positive, so the factorization
*>                could not be completed, and the solution has not been
*>                computed.
