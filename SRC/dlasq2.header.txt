*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> DLASQ2 computes all the eigenvalues of the symmetric positive
*> definite tridiagonal matrix associated with the qd array Z to high
*> relative accuracy are computed to high relative accuracy, in the
*> absence of denormalization, underflow and overflow.
*>
*> To see the relation of Z to the tridiagonal matrix, let L be a
*> unit lower bidiagonal matrix with subdiagonals Z(2,4,6,,..) and
*> let U be an upper bidiagonal matrix with 1's above and diagonal
*> Z(1,3,5,,..). The tridiagonal is L*U or, if you prefer, the
*> symmetric tridiagonal to which it is similar.
*>
*> Note : DLASQ2 defines a logical variable, IEEE, which is true
*> on machines which follow ieee-754 floating-point standard in their
*> handling of infinities and NaNs, and false otherwise. This variable
*> is passed to DLASQ3.

*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>        The number of rows and columns in the matrix. N >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] Z
*> \verbatim
*>          Z is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( 4*N )
*>        On entry Z holds the qd array. On exit, entries 1 to N hold
*>        the eigenvalues in decreasing order, Z( 2*N+1 ) holds the
*>        trace, and Z( 2*N+2 ) holds the sum of the eigenvalues. If
*>        N > 2, then Z( 2*N+3 ) holds the iteration count, Z( 2*N+4 )
*>        holds NDIVS/NIN^2, and Z( 2*N+5 ) holds the percentage of
*>        shifts that failed.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] INFO
*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>        = 0: successful exit
*>        < 0: if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal
*>             value, then INFO = -i, if the i-th argument is an
*>             array and the j-entry had an illegal value, then
*>             INFO = -(i*100+j)
*>        > 0: the algorithm failed
*>              = 1, a split was marked by a positive value in E
*>              = 2, current block of Z not diagonalized after 100*N
*>                   iterations (in inner while loop).  On exit Z holds
*>                   a qd array with the same eigenvalues as the given Z.
*>              = 3, termination criterion of outer while loop not met
*>                   (program created more than N unreduced blocks)
