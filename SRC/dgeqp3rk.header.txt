*  =============

*> \verbatim
*>
*> DGEQP3RK performs two tasks simultaneously:
*>
*> Task 1: The routine computes a truncated (rank K) or full rank
*> Householder QR factorization with column pivoting of a real
*> M-by-N matrix A using Level 3 BLAS. K is the number of columns
*> that were factorized, i.e. factorization rank of the
*> factor R, K <= min(M,N).
*>
*>  A * P(K) = Q(K) * R(K)  =
*>
*>        = Q(K) * ( R11(K) R12(K) ) = Q(K) * (   R(K)_approx    )
*>                 ( 0      R22(K) )          ( 0  R(K)_residual ),
*>
*> where:
*>
*>  P(K)            is an N-by-N permutation matrix;
*>  Q(K)            is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix;
*>  R(K)_approx   = ( R11(K), R12(K) ) is a rank K approximation of the
*>                    full rank factor R with K-by-K upper-triangular
*>                    R11(K) and K-by-N rectangular R12(K). The diagonal
*>                    entries of R11(K) appear in non-increasing order
*>                    of absolute value, and absolute values of all of
*>                    them exceed the maximum column 2-norm of R22(K)
*>                    up to roundoff error.
*>  R(K)_residual = R22(K) is the residual of a rank K approximation
*>                    of the full rank factor R. It is a
*>                    an (M-K)-by-(N-K) rectangular matrix;
*>  0               is a an (M-K)-by-K zero matrix.
*>
*> Task 2: At the same time, the routine overwrites a real M-by-NRHS
*> matrix B with  Q(K)**T * B  using Level 3 BLAS.
*>
*> =====================================================================
*>
*> The matrices A and B are stored on input in the array A as
*> the left and right blocks A(1:M,1:N) and A(1:M, N+1:N+NRHS)
*> respectively.
*>
*>                                  N     NRHS
*>             array_A   =   M  [ mat_A, mat_B ]
*>
*> The truncation criteria (i.e. when to stop the factorization)
*> can be any of the following:
*>
*>   1) The input parameter KMAX, the maximum number of columns
*>      KMAX to factorize, i.e. the factorization rank is limited
*>      to KMAX. If KMAX >= min(M,N), the criterion is not used.
*>
*>   2) The input parameter ABSTOL, the absolute tolerance for
*>      the maximum column 2-norm of the residual matrix R22(K). This
*>      means that the factorization stops if this norm is less or
*>      equal to ABSTOL. If ABSTOL < 0.0, the criterion is not used.
*>
*>   3) The input parameter RELTOL, the tolerance for the maximum
*>      column 2-norm matrix of the residual matrix R22(K) divided
*>      by the maximum column 2-norm of the original matrix A, which
*>      is equal to abs(R(1,1)). This means that the factorization stops
*>      when the ratio of the maximum column 2-norm of R22(K) to
*>      the maximum column 2-norm of A is less than or equal to RELTOL.
*>      If RELTOL < 0.0, the criterion is not used.
*>
*>   4) In case both stopping criteria ABSTOL or RELTOL are not used,
*>      and when the residual matrix R22(K) is a zero matrix in some
*>      factorization step K. ( This stopping criterion is implicit. )
*>
*>  The algorithm stops when any of these conditions is first
*>  satisfied, otherwise the whole matrix A is factorized.
*>
*>  To factorize the whole matrix A, use the values
*>  KMAX >= min(M,N), ABSTOL < 0.0 and RELTOL < 0.0.
*>
*>  The routine returns:
*>     a) Q(K), R(K)_approx = ( R11(K), R12(K) ),
*>        R(K)_residual = R22(K), P(K), i.e. the resulting matrices
*>        of the factorization; P(K) is represented by JPIV,
*>        ( if K = min(M,N), R(K)_approx is the full factor R,
*>        and there is no residual matrix R(K)_residual);
*>     b) K, the number of columns that were factorized,
*>        i.e. factorization rank;
*>     c) MAXC2NRMK, the maximum column 2-norm of the residual
*>        matrix R(K)_residual = R22(K),
*>        ( if K = min(M,N), MAXC2NRMK = 0.0 );
*>     d) RELMAXC2NRMK equals MAXC2NRMK divided by MAXC2NRM, the maximum
*>        column 2-norm of the original matrix A, which is equal
*>        to abs(R(1,1)), ( if K = min(M,N), RELMAXC2NRMK = 0.0 );
*>     e) Q(K)**T * B, the matrix B with the orthogonal
*>        transformation Q(K)**T applied on the left.
*>
*> The N-by-N permutation matrix P(K) is stored in a compact form in
*> the integer array JPIV. For 1 <= j <= N, column j
*> of the matrix A was interchanged with column JPIV(j).
*>
*> The M-by-M orthogonal matrix Q is represented as a product
*> of elementary Householder reflectors
*>
*>     Q(K) = H(1) *  H(2) * . . . * H(K),
*>
*> where K is the number of columns that were factorized.
*>
*> Each H(j) has the form
*>
*>     H(j) = I - tau * v * v**T,
*>
*> where 1 <= j <= K and
*>   I    is an M-by-M identity matrix,
*>   tau  is a real scalar,
*>   v    is a real vector with v(1:j-1) = 0 and v(j) = 1.
*>
*> v(j+1:M) is stored on exit in A(j+1:M,j) and tau in TAU(j).
*>

*> DGEQP3RK is based on the same BLAS3 Householder QR factorization
*> algorithm with column pivoting as in DGEQP3 routine which uses
*> DLARFG routine to generate Householder reflectors
*> for QR factorization.
*>
*> We can also write:
*>
*>   A = A_approx(K) + A_residual(K)
*>
*> The low rank approximation matrix A(K)_approx from
*> the truncated QR factorization of rank K of the matrix A is:
*>
*>   A(K)_approx = Q(K) * ( R(K)_approx ) * P(K)**T
*>                        (     0     0 )
*>
*>               = Q(K) * ( R11(K) R12(K) ) * P(K)**T
*>                        (      0      0 )
*>
*> The residual A_residual(K) of the matrix A is:
*>
*>   A_residual(K) = Q(K) * ( 0              0 ) * P(K)**T =
*>                          ( 0  R(K)_residual )
*>
*>                 = Q(K) * ( 0        0 ) * P(K)**T
*>                          ( 0   R22(K) )
*>
*> The truncated (rank K) factorization guarantees that
*> the maximum column 2-norm of A_residual(K) is less than
*> or equal to MAXC2NRMK up to roundoff error.
*>
*> NOTE: An approximation of the null vectors
*>       of A can be easily computed from R11(K)
*>       and R12(K):
*>
*>       Null( A(K) )_approx = P * ( inv(R11(K)) * R12(K) )
*>                                 (         -I           )
