*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> DLAQP3RK computes a step of truncated QR factorization with column
*> pivoting of a real M-by-N matrix A block A(IOFFSET+1:M,1:N)
*> by using Level 3 BLAS as
*>
*>   A * P(KB) = Q(KB) * R(KB).
*>
*> The routine tries to factorize NB columns from A starting from
*> the row IOFFSET+1 and updates the residual matrix with BLAS 3
*> xGEMM. The number of actually factorized columns is returned
*> is smaller than NB.
*>
*> Block A(1:IOFFSET,1:N) is accordingly pivoted, but not factorized.
*>
*> The routine also overwrites the right-hand-sides B matrix stored
*> in A(IOFFSET+1:M,1:N+1:N+NRHS) with Q(KB)**T * B.
*>
*> Cases when the number of factorized columns KB < NB:
*>
*> (1) In some cases, due to catastrophic cancellations, it cannot
*> factorize all NB columns and need to update the residual matrix.
*> Hence, the actual number of factorized columns in the block returned
*> in KB is smaller than NB. The logical DONE is returned as FALSE.
*> The factorization of the whole original matrix A_orig must proceed
*> with the next block.
*>
*> (2) Whenever the stopping criterion ABSTOL or RELTOL is satisfied,
*> the factorization of the whole original matrix A_orig is stopped,
*> the logical DONE is returned as TRUE. The number of factorized
*> columns which is smaller than NB is returned in KB.
*>
*> (3) In case both stopping criteria ABSTOL or RELTOL are not used,
*> and when the residual matrix is a zero matrix in some factorization
*> step KB, the factorization of the whole original matrix A_orig is
*> stopped, the logical DONE is returned as TRUE. The number of
*> factorized columns which is smaller than NB is returned in KB.
*>
*> (4) Whenever NaN is detected in the matrix A or in the array TAU,
*> the factorization of the whole original matrix A_orig is stopped,
*> the logical DONE is returned as TRUE. The number of factorized
*> columns which is smaller than NB is returned in KB. The INFO
*> parameter is set to the column index of the first NaN occurrence.
