*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> SGSVJ1 is called from SGESVJ as a pre-processor and that is its main
*> purpose. It applies Jacobi rotations in the same way as SGESVJ does, but
*> it targets only particular pivots and it does not check convergence
*> (stopping criterion). Few tuning parameters (marked by [TP]) are
*> available for the implementer.
*>
*> Further Details
*> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*> SGSVJ1 applies few sweeps of Jacobi rotations in the column space of
*> the input M-by-N matrix A. The pivot pairs are taken from the (1,2)
*> off-diagonal block in the corresponding N-by-N Gram matrix A^T * A. The
*> block-entries (tiles) of the (1,2) off-diagonal block are marked by the
*> [x]'s in the following scheme:
*>
*>    | *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|
*>    | *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|    Row-cycling in the nblr-by-nblc [x] blocks.
*>    | *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|    Row-cyclic pivoting inside each [x] block.
*>    |[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |
*>    |[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |
*>    |[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |
*>
*> In terms of the columns of A, the first N1 columns are rotated 'against'
*> the remaining N-N1 columns, trying to increase the angle between the
*> corresponding subspaces. The off-diagonal block is N1-by(N-N1) and it is
*> tiled using quadratic tiles of side KBL. Here, KBL is a tuning parameter.
*> The number of sweeps is given in NSWEEP and the orthogonality threshold
*> is given in TOL.
