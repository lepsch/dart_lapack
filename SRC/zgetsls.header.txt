*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> ZGETSLS solves overdetermined or underdetermined complex linear systems
*> involving an M-by-N matrix A, using a tall skinny QR or short wide LQ
*> factorization of A.  It is assumed that A has full rank.
*>
*>
*>
*> The following options are provided:
*>
*> 1. If TRANS = 'N' and m >= n:  find the least squares solution of
*>    an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
*>                 minimize || B - A*X ||.
*>
*> 2. If TRANS = 'N' and m < n:  find the minimum norm solution of
*>    an underdetermined system A * X = B.
*>
*> 3. If TRANS = 'C' and m >= n:  find the minimum norm solution of
*>    an undetermined system A**T * X = B.
*>
*> 4. If TRANS = 'C' and m < n:  find the least squares solution of
*>    an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
*>                 minimize || B - A**T * X ||.
*>
*> Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
*> handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
*> M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
*> matrix X.

*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] TRANS
*> \verbatim
*>          TRANS is CHARACTER*1
*>          = 'N': the linear system involves A;
*>          = 'C': the linear system involves A**H.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] M
*> \verbatim
*>          M is INTEGER
*>          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NRHS
*> \verbatim
*>          NRHS is INTEGER
*>          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of
*>          columns of the matrices B and X. NRHS >=0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*>          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
*>          On exit,
*>          A is overwritten by details of its QR or LQ
*>          factorization as returned by ZGEQR or ZGELQ.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDA
*> \verbatim
*>          LDA is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] B
*> \verbatim
*>          B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*>          On entry, the matrix B of right hand side vectors, stored
*>          columnwise; B is M-by-NRHS if TRANS = 'N', or N-by-NRHS
*>          if TRANS = 'C'.
*>          On exit, if INFO = 0, B is overwritten by the solution
*>          vectors, stored columnwise:
*>          if TRANS = 'N' and m >= n, rows 1 to n of B contain the least
*>          squares solution vectors.
*>          if TRANS = 'N' and m < n, rows 1 to N of B contain the
*>          minimum norm solution vectors;
*>          if TRANS = 'C' and m >= n, rows 1 to M of B contain the
*>          minimum norm solution vectors;
*>          if TRANS = 'C' and m < n, rows 1 to M of B contain the
*>          least squares solution vectors.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDB
*> \verbatim
*>          LDB is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= MAX(1,M,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] WORK
*> \verbatim
*>          (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*>          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) contains optimal (or either minimal
*>          or optimal, if query was assumed) LWORK.
*>          See LWORK for details.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LWORK
*> \verbatim
*>          LWORK is INTEGER
*>          The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= 1.
*>          If LWORK = -1 or -2, then a workspace query is assumed.
*>          If LWORK = -1, the routine calculates optimal size of WORK for the
*>          optimal performance and returns this value in WORK(1).
*>          If LWORK = -2, the routine calculates minimal size of WORK and 
*>          returns this value in WORK(1).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] INFO
*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>          = 0:  successful exit
*>          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*>          > 0:  if INFO =  i, the i-th diagonal element of the
*>                triangular factor of A is zero, so that A does not have
*>                full rank; the least squares solution could not be
*>                computed.
