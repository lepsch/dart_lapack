*> CLA_PORFSX_EXTENDED improves the computed solution to a system of
*> linear equations by performing extra-precise iterative refinement
*> and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.
*> This subroutine is called by CPORFSX to perform iterative refinement.
*> In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides maximum
*> componentwise error bound if possible. See comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM
*> and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds. Note that this
*> subroutine is only responsible for setting the second fields of
*> ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP.
*> \endverbatim
*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] PREC_TYPE
*> \verbatim
*>          PREC_TYPE is INTEGER
*>     Specifies the intermediate precision to be used in refinement.
*>     The value is defined by ILAPREC(P) where P is a CHARACTER and P
*>          = 'S':  Single
*>          = 'D':  Double
*>          = 'I':  Indigenous
*>          = 'X' or 'E':  Extra
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] UPLO
*> \verbatim
*>          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
*>       = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*>       = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>     The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
*>     matrix A.  N >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NRHS
*> \verbatim
*>          NRHS is INTEGER
*>     The number of right-hand-sides, i.e., the number of columns of the
*>     matrix B.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
*>     On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDA
*> \verbatim
*>          LDA is INTEGER
*>     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] AF
*> \verbatim
*>          AF is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAF,N)
*>     The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
*>     A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by CPOTRF.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDAF
*> \verbatim
*>          LDAF is INTEGER
*>     The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] COLEQU
*> \verbatim
*>          COLEQU is LOGICAL
*>     If .TRUE. then column equilibration was done to A before calling
*>     this routine. This is needed to compute the solution and error
*>     bounds correctly.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] C
*> \verbatim
*>          C is REAL array, dimension (N)
*>     The column scale factors for A. If COLEQU = .FALSE., C
*>     is not accessed. If C is input, each element of C should be a power
*>     of the radix to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates.
*>     Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless
*>     the result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
*>     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
*>     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
*>     reliable.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] B
*> \verbatim
*>          B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*>     The right-hand-side matrix B.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDB
*> \verbatim
*>          LDB is INTEGER
*>     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] Y
*> \verbatim
*>          Y is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDY,NRHS)
*>     On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by CPOTRS.
*>     On exit, the improved solution matrix Y.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDY
*> \verbatim
*>          LDY is INTEGER
*>     The leading dimension of the array Y.  LDY >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] BERR_OUT
*> \verbatim
*>          BERR_OUT is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
*>     On exit, BERR_OUT(j) contains the componentwise relative backward
*>     error for right-hand-side j from the formula
*>         max(i) ( abs(RES(i)) / ( abs(op(A_s))*abs(Y) + abs(B_s) )(i) )
*>     where abs(Z) is the componentwise absolute value of the matrix
*>     or vector Z. This is computed by CLA_LIN_BERR.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N_NORMS
*> \verbatim
*>          N_NORMS is INTEGER
*>     Determines which error bounds to return (see ERR_BNDS_NORM
*>     and ERR_BNDS_COMP).
*>     If N_NORMS >= 1 return normwise error bounds.
*>     If N_NORMS >= 2 return componentwise error bounds.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] ERR_BNDS_NORM
*> \verbatim
*>          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
*>     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
*>     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
*>     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
*>
*>     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
*>             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
*>            ------------------------------
*>                  max_j abs(X(j,i))
*>
*>     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
*>     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
*>     returned.
*>
*>     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
*>     right-hand side.
*>
*>     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
*>     three fields:
*>     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
*>              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
*>              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').
*>
*>     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
*>              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
*>              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
*>              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
*>              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.
*>
*>     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
*>              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
*>              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
*>              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
*>              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
*>              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
*>              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
*>              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.
*>
*>     This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
*>     above.
*>     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
*>     cautions.

*>
*> \param[in,out] ERR_BNDS_COMP
*> \verbatim
*>          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
*>     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
*>     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
*>     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:
*>
*>     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
*>                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
*>             max_j ----------------------
*>                         abs(X(j,i))
*>
*>     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
*>     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
*>     information as described below. There currently are up to three
*>     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
*>     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
*>     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS < 3, then at most
*>     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.
*>
*>     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
*>     right-hand side.
*>
*>     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
*>     three fields:
*>     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
