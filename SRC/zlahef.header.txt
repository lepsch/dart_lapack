*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> ZLAHEF computes a partial factorization of a complex Hermitian
*> matrix A using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method. The
*> partial factorization has the form:
*>
*> A  =  ( I  U12 ) ( A11  0  ) (  I      0     )  if UPLO = 'U', or:
*>       ( 0  U22 ) (  0   D  ) ( U12**H U22**H )
*>
*> A  =  ( L11  0 ) (  D   0  ) ( L11**H L21**H )  if UPLO = 'L'
*>       ( L21  I ) (  0  A22 ) (  0      I     )
*>
*> where the order of D is at most NB. The actual order is returned in
*> the argument KB, and is either NB or NB-1, or N if N <= NB.
*> Note that U**H denotes the conjugate transpose of U.
*>
*> ZLAHEF is an auxiliary routine called by ZHETRF. It uses blocked code
*> (calling Level 3 BLAS) to update the submatrix A11 (if UPLO = 'U') or
*> A22 (if UPLO = 'L').
*> \endverbatim
*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] UPLO
*> \verbatim
*>          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
*>          Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
*>          Hermitian matrix A is stored:
*>          = 'U':  Upper triangular
*>          = 'L':  Lower triangular
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NB
*> \verbatim
*>          NB is INTEGER
*>          The maximum number of columns of the matrix A that should be
*>          factored.  NB should be at least 2 to allow for 2-by-2 pivot
*>          blocks.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] KB
*> \verbatim
*>          KB is INTEGER
*>          The number of columns of A that were actually factored.
*>          KB is either NB-1 or NB, or N if N <= NB.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*>          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*>          n-by-n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*>          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*>          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*>          leading n-by-n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*>          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*>          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*>          On exit, A contains details of the partial factorization.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDA
*> \verbatim
*>          LDA is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] IPIV
*> \verbatim
*>          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
*>
*>          If UPLO = 'U':
*>             Only the last KB elements of IPIV are set.
*>
*>             If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*>             interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*>
*>             If IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and columns
*>             k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
*>             is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*>
*>          If UPLO = 'L':
*>             Only the first KB elements of IPIV are set.
*>
*>             If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
*>             interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*>
*>             If IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns
*>             k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1)
*>             is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] W
*> \verbatim
*>          W is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDW,NB)
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDW
*> \verbatim
*>          LDW is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array W.  LDW >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] INFO
*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>          = 0: successful exit
*>          > 0: if INFO = k, D(k,k) is exactly zero.  The factorization
*>               has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
*>               exactly singular.
