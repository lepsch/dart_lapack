*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> DSYTRF_AA_2STAGE computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A
*> using the Aasen's algorithm.  The form of the factorization is
*>
*>    A = U**T*T*U  or  A = L*T*L**T
*>
*> where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
*> triangular matrices, and T is a symmetric band matrix with the
*> bandwidth of NB (NB is internally selected and stored in TB( 1 ), and T is 
*> LU factorized with partial pivoting).
*>
*> This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.
*> \endverbatim
*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] UPLO
*> \verbatim
*>          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
*>          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*>          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*>          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
*>          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
*>          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
*>          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
*>          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
*>          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
*>          triangular part of A is not referenced.
*>
*>          On exit, L is stored below (or above) the subdiagonal blocks,
*>          when UPLO  is 'L' (or 'U').
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDA
*> \verbatim
*>          LDA is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] TB
*> \verbatim
*>          TB is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LTB))
*>          On exit, details of the LU factorization of the band matrix.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LTB
*> \verbatim
*>          LTB is INTEGER
*>          The size of the array TB. LTB >= MAX(1,4*N), internally
*>          used to select NB such that LTB >= (3*NB+1)*N.
*>
*>          If LTB = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
*>          routine only calculates the optimal size of LTB, 
*>          returns this value as the first entry of TB, and
*>          no error message related to LTB is issued by XERBLA.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] IPIV
*> \verbatim
*>          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>          On exit, it contains the details of the interchanges, i.e.,
*>          the row and column k of A were interchanged with the
*>          row and column IPIV(k).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] IPIV2
*> \verbatim
*>          IPIV2 is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>          On exit, it contains the details of the interchanges, i.e.,
*>          the row and column k of T were interchanged with the
*>          row and column IPIV2(k).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] WORK
*> \verbatim
*>          WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION workspace of size (MAX(1,LWORK))
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LWORK
*> \verbatim
*>          LWORK is INTEGER
*>          The size of WORK. LWORK >= MAX(1,N), internally used
*>          to select NB such that LWORK >= N*NB.
*>
*>          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
*>          routine only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array,
*>          returns this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and
*>          no error message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] INFO
*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>          = 0:  successful exit
*>          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
*>          > 0:  if INFO = i, band LU factorization failed on i-th column
