*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> This routine is deprecated and has been replaced by routine ZGELSY.
*>
*> ZGELSX computes the minimum-norm solution to a complex linear least
*> squares problem:
*>     minimize || A * X - B ||
*> using a complete orthogonal factorization of A.  A is an M-by-N
*> matrix which may be rank-deficient.
*>
*> Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
*> handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
*> M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
*> matrix X.
*>
*> The routine first computes a QR factorization with column pivoting:
*>     A * P = Q * [ R11 R12 ]
*>                 [  0  R22 ]
*> with R11 defined as the largest leading submatrix whose estimated
*> condition number is less than 1/RCOND.  The order of R11, RANK,
*> is the effective rank of A.
*>
*> Then, R22 is considered to be negligible, and R12 is annihilated
*> by unitary transformations from the right, arriving at the
*> complete orthogonal factorization:
*>    A * P = Q * [ T11 0 ] * Z
*>                [  0  0 ]
*> The minimum-norm solution is then
*>    X = P * Z**H [ inv(T11)*Q1**H*B ]
*>                 [        0         ]
*> where Q1 consists of the first RANK columns of Q.

*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] M
*> \verbatim
*>          M is INTEGER
*>          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NRHS
*> \verbatim
*>          NRHS is INTEGER
*>          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of
*>          columns of matrices B and X. NRHS >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*>          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
*>          On exit, A has been overwritten by details of its
*>          complete orthogonal factorization.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDA
*> \verbatim
*>          LDA is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] B
*> \verbatim
*>          B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*>          On entry, the M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
*>          On exit, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.
*>          If m >= n and RANK = n, the residual sum-of-squares for
*>          the solution in the i-th column is given by the sum of
*>          squares of elements N+1:M in that column.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDB
*> \verbatim
*>          LDB is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= max(1,M,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] JPVT
*> \verbatim
*>          JPVT is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>          On entry, if JPVT(i) .ne. 0, the i-th column of A is an
*>          initial column, otherwise it is a free column.  Before
*>          the QR factorization of A, all initial columns are
*>          permuted to the leading positions; only the remaining
*>          free columns are moved as a result of column pivoting
*>          during the factorization.
*>          On exit, if JPVT(i) = k, then the i-th column of A*P
*>          was the k-th column of A.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] RCOND
*> \verbatim
*>          RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
*>          RCOND is used to determine the effective rank of A, which
*>          is defined as the order of the largest leading triangular
*>          submatrix R11 in the QR factorization with pivoting of A,
*>          whose estimated condition number < 1/RCOND.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] RANK
*> \verbatim
*>          RANK is INTEGER
*>          The effective rank of A, i.e., the order of the submatrix
*>          R11.  This is the same as the order of the submatrix T11
*>          in the complete orthogonal factorization of A.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] WORK
*> \verbatim
*>          WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension
*>                      (min(M,N) + max( N, 2*min(M,N)+NRHS )),

*> \verbatim
*>          RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (2*N)
*> \endverbatim

*> \param[out] INFO
*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>          = 0:  successful exit
