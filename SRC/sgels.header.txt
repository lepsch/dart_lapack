*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> SGELS solves overdetermined or underdetermined real linear systems
*> involving an M-by-N matrix A, or its transpose, using a QR or LQ
*> factorization of A.  It is assumed that A has full rank.
*>
*> The following options are provided:
*>
*> 1. If TRANS = 'N' and m >= n:  find the least squares solution of
*>    an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
*>                 minimize || B - A*X ||.
*>
*> 2. If TRANS = 'N' and m < n:  find the minimum norm solution of
*>    an underdetermined system A * X = B.
*>
*> 3. If TRANS = 'T' and m >= n:  find the minimum norm solution of
*>    an underdetermined system A**T * X = B.
*>
*> 4. If TRANS = 'T' and m < n:  find the least squares solution of
*>    an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
*>                 minimize || B - A**T * X ||.
*>
*> Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
*> handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
*> M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
*> matrix X.
*> \endverbatim
*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] TRANS
*> \verbatim
*>          TRANS is CHARACTER*1
*>          = 'N': the linear system involves A;
*>          = 'T': the linear system involves A**T.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] M
*> \verbatim
*>          M is INTEGER
*>          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NRHS
*> \verbatim
*>          NRHS is INTEGER
*>          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of
*>          columns of the matrices B and X. NRHS >=0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
*>          On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
*>          On exit,
*>            if M >= N, A is overwritten by details of its QR
*>                       factorization as returned by SGEQRF;
*>            if M <  N, A is overwritten by details of its LQ
*>                       factorization as returned by SGELQF.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDA
*> \verbatim
*>          LDA is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] B
*> \verbatim
*>          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*>          On entry, the matrix B of right hand side vectors, stored
*>          columnwise; B is M-by-NRHS if TRANS = 'N', or N-by-NRHS
*>          if TRANS = 'T'.
*>          On exit, if INFO = 0, B is overwritten by the solution
*>          vectors, stored columnwise:
*>          if TRANS = 'N' and m >= n, rows 1 to n of B contain the least
*>          squares solution vectors; the residual sum of squares for the
*>          solution in each column is given by the sum of squares of
*>          elements N+1 to M in that column;
*>          if TRANS = 'N' and m < n, rows 1 to N of B contain the
*>          minimum norm solution vectors;
*>          if TRANS = 'T' and m >= n, rows 1 to M of B contain the
*>          minimum norm solution vectors;
*>          if TRANS = 'T' and m < n, rows 1 to M of B contain the
*>          least squares solution vectors; the residual sum of squares
*>          for the solution in each column is given by the sum of
*>          squares of elements M+1 to N in that column.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDB
*> \verbatim
*>          LDB is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array B. LDB >= MAX(1,M,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] WORK
*> \verbatim
*>          WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*>          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LWORK
*> \verbatim
*>          LWORK is INTEGER
*>          The dimension of the array WORK.
*>          LWORK >= max( 1, MN + max( MN, NRHS ) ).
*>          For optimal performance,
*>          LWORK >= max( 1, MN + max( MN, NRHS )*NB ).
*>          where MN = min(M,N) and NB is the optimum block size.
*>
*>          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*>          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*>          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*>          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[out] INFO
*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
*>          = 0:  successful exit
*>          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*>          > 0:  if INFO =  i, the i-th diagonal element of the
*>                triangular factor of A is zero, so that A does not have
*>                full rank; the least squares solution could not be
*>                computed.
