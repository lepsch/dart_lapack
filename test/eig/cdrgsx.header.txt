*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> CDRGSX checks the nonsymmetric generalized eigenvalue (Schur form)
*> problem expert driver CGGESX.
*>
*> CGGES factors A and B as Q*S*Z'  and Q*T*Z' , where ' means conjugate
*> transpose, S and T are  upper triangular (i.e., in generalized Schur
*> form), and Q and Z are unitary. It also computes the generalized
*> eigenvalues (alpha(j),beta(j)), j=1,...,n.  Thus,
*> w(j) = alpha(j)/beta(j) is a root of the characteristic equation
*>
*>                 det( A - w(j) B ) = 0
*>
*> Optionally it also reorders the eigenvalues so that a selected
*> cluster of eigenvalues appears in the leading diagonal block of the
*> Schur forms; computes a reciprocal condition number for the average
*> of the selected eigenvalues; and computes a reciprocal condition
*> number for the right and left deflating subspaces corresponding to
*> the selected eigenvalues.
*>
*> When CDRGSX is called with NSIZE > 0, five (5) types of built-in
*> matrix pairs are used to test the routine CGGESX.
*>
*> When CDRGSX is called with NSIZE = 0, it reads in test matrix data
*> to test CGGESX.
*> (need more details on what kind of read-in data are needed).
*>
*> For each matrix pair, the following tests will be performed and
*> compared with the threshold THRESH except for the tests (7) and (9):
*>
*> (1)   | A - Q S Z' | / ( |A| n ulp )
*>
*> (2)   | B - Q T Z' | / ( |B| n ulp )
*>
*> (3)   | I - QQ' | / ( n ulp )
*>
*> (4)   | I - ZZ' | / ( n ulp )
*>
*> (5)   if A is in Schur form (i.e. triangular form)
*>
*> (6)   maximum over j of D(j)  where:
*>
*>                     |alpha(j) - S(j,j)|        |beta(j) - T(j,j)|
*>           D(j) = ------------------------ + -----------------------
*>                  max(|alpha(j)|,|S(j,j)|)   max(|beta(j)|,|T(j,j)|)
*>
*> (7)   if sorting worked and SDIM is the number of eigenvalues
*>       which were selected.
*>
*> (8)   the estimated value DIF does not differ from the true values of
*>       Difu and Difl more than a factor 10*THRESH. If the estimate DIF
*>       equals zero the corresponding true values of Difu and Difl
*>       should be less than EPS*norm(A, B). If the true value of Difu
*>       and Difl equal zero, the estimate DIF should be less than
*>       EPS*norm(A, B).
*>
*> (9)   If INFO = N+3 is returned by CGGESX, the reordering "failed"
*>       and we check that DIF = PL = PR = 0 and that the true value of
*>       Difu and Difl is < EPS*norm(A, B). We count the events when
*>       INFO=N+3.
*>
*> For read-in test matrices, the same tests are run except that the
*> exact value for DIF (and PL) is input data.  Additionally, there is
*> one more test run for read-in test matrices:
*>
*> (10)  the estimated value PL does not differ from the true value of
*>       PLTRU more than a factor THRESH. If the estimate PL equals
*>       zero the corresponding true value of PLTRU should be less than
*>       EPS*norm(A, B). If the true value of PLTRU equal zero, the
*>       estimate PL should be less than EPS*norm(A, B).
*>
*> Note that for the built-in tests, a total of 10*NSIZE*(NSIZE-1)
*> matrix pairs are generated and tested. NSIZE should be kept small.
*>
*> SVD (routine CGESVD) is used for computing the true value of DIF_u
*> and DIF_l when testing the built-in test problems.
*>
*> Built-in Test Matrices
*> ======================
*>
*> All built-in test matrices are the 2 by 2 block of triangular
*> matrices
*>
*>          A = [ A11 A12 ]    and      B = [ B11 B12 ]
*>              [     A22 ]                 [     B22 ]
*>
*> where for different type of A11 and A22 are given as the following.
*> A12 and B12 are chosen so that the generalized Sylvester equation
*>
*>          A11*R - L*A22 = -A12
*>          B11*R - L*B22 = -B12
*>
*> have prescribed solution R and L.
*>
*> Type 1:  A11 = J_m(1,-1) and A_22 = J_k(1-a,1).
*>          B11 = I_m, B22 = I_k
*>          where J_k(a,b) is the k-by-k Jordan block with ``a'' on
*>          diagonal and ``b'' on superdiagonal.
*>
*> Type 2:  A11 = (a_ij) = ( 2(.5-sin(i)) ) and
*>          B11 = (b_ij) = ( 2(.5-sin(ij)) ) for i=1,...,m, j=i,...,m
*>          A22 = (a_ij) = ( 2(.5-sin(i+j)) ) and
*>          B22 = (b_ij) = ( 2(.5-sin(ij)) ) for i=m+1,...,k, j=i,...,k
*>
*> Type 3:  A11, A22 and B11, B22 are chosen as for Type 2, but each
*>          second diagonal block in A_11 and each third diagonal block
*>          in A_22 are made as 2 by 2 blocks.
*>
*> Type 4:  A11 = ( 20(.5 - sin(ij)) ) and B22 = ( 2(.5 - sin(i+j)) )
*>             for i=1,...,m,  j=1,...,m and
*>          A22 = ( 20(.5 - sin(i+j)) ) and B22 = ( 2(.5 - sin(ij)) )
*>             for i=m+1,...,k,  j=m+1,...,k
*>
*> Type 5:  (A,B) and have potentially close or common eigenvalues and
*>          very large departure from block diagonality A_11 is chosen
*>          as the m x m leading submatrix of A_1:
*>                  |  1  b                            |
*>                  | -b  1                            |
*>                  |        1+d  b                    |
*>                  |         -b 1+d                   |
*>           A_1 =  |                  d  1            |
*>                  |                 -1  d            |
*>                  |                        -d  1     |
*>                  |                        -1 -d     |
*>                  |                               1  |
*>          and A_22 is chosen as the k x k leading submatrix of A_2:
*>                  | -1  b                            |
*>                  | -b -1                            |
*>                  |       1-d  b                     |
*>                  |       -b  1-d                    |
*>           A_2 =  |                 d 1+b            |
*>                  |               -1-b d             |
*>                  |                       -d  1+b    |
*>                  |                      -1+b  -d    |
*>                  |                              1-d |
*>          and matrix B are chosen as identity matrices (see SLATM5).
