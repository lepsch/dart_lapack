*>
*>    CDRVVX  checks the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem expert driver
*>    CGEEVX.
*>
*>    CDRVVX uses both test matrices generated randomly depending on
*>    data supplied in the calling sequence, as well as on data
*>    read from an input file and including precomputed condition
*>    numbers to which it compares the ones it computes.
*>
*>    When CDRVVX is called, a number of matrix "sizes" ("n's") and a
*>    number of matrix "types" are specified in the calling sequence.
*>    For each size ("n") and each type of matrix, one matrix will be
*>    generated and used to test the nonsymmetric eigenroutines.  For
*>    each matrix, 9 tests will be performed:
*>
*>    (1)     | A * VR - VR * W | / ( n |A| ulp )
*>
*>      Here VR is the matrix of unit right eigenvectors.
*>      W is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries W(j).
*>
*>    (2)     | A**H  * VL - VL * W**H | / ( n |A| ulp )
*>
*>      Here VL is the matrix of unit left eigenvectors, A**H is the
*>      conjugate transpose of A, and W is as above.
*>
*>    (3)     | |VR(i)| - 1 | / ulp and largest component real
*>
*>      VR(i) denotes the i-th column of VR.
*>
*>    (4)     | |VL(i)| - 1 | / ulp and largest component real
*>
*>      VL(i) denotes the i-th column of VL.
*>
*>    (5)     W(full) = W(partial)
*>
*>      W(full) denotes the eigenvalues computed when VR, VL, RCONDV
*>      and RCONDE are also computed, and W(partial) denotes the
*>      eigenvalues computed when only some of VR, VL, RCONDV, and
*>      RCONDE are computed.
*>
*>    (6)     VR(full) = VR(partial)
*>
*>      VR(full) denotes the right eigenvectors computed when VL, RCONDV
*>      and RCONDE are computed, and VR(partial) denotes the result
*>      when only some of VL and RCONDV are computed.
*>
*>    (7)     VL(full) = VL(partial)
*>
*>      VL(full) denotes the left eigenvectors computed when VR, RCONDV
*>      and RCONDE are computed, and VL(partial) denotes the result
*>      when only some of VR and RCONDV are computed.
*>
*>    (8)     0 if SCALE, ILO, IHI, ABNRM (full) =
*>                 SCALE, ILO, IHI, ABNRM (partial)
*>            1/ulp otherwise
*>
*>      SCALE, ILO, IHI and ABNRM describe how the matrix is balanced.
*>      (full) is when VR, VL, RCONDE and RCONDV are also computed, and
*>      (partial) is when some are not computed.
*>
*>    (9)     RCONDV(full) = RCONDV(partial)
*>
*>      RCONDV(full) denotes the reciprocal condition numbers of the
*>      right eigenvectors computed when VR, VL and RCONDE are also
*>      computed. RCONDV(partial) denotes the reciprocal condition
*>      numbers when only some of VR, VL and RCONDE are computed.
*>
*>    The "sizes" are specified by an array NN(1:NSIZES); the value of
*>    each element NN(j) specifies one size.
*>    The "types" are specified by a logical array DOTYPE( 1:NTYPES );
*>    if DOTYPE(j) is .TRUE., then matrix type "j" will be generated.
*>    Currently, the list of possible types is:
*>
*>    (1)  The zero matrix.
*>    (2)  The identity matrix.
*>    (3)  A (transposed) Jordan block, with 1's on the diagonal.
*>
*>    (4)  A diagonal matrix with evenly spaced entries
*>         1, ..., ULP  and random complex angles.
*>         (ULP = (first number larger than 1) - 1 )
*>    (5)  A diagonal matrix with geometrically spaced entries
*>         1, ..., ULP  and random complex angles.
*>    (6)  A diagonal matrix with "clustered" entries 1, ULP, ..., ULP
*>         and random complex angles.
*>
*>    (7)  Same as (4), but multiplied by a constant near
*>         the overflow threshold
*>    (8)  Same as (4), but multiplied by a constant near
*>         the underflow threshold
*>
*>    (9)  A matrix of the form  U' T U, where U is unitary and
*>         T has evenly spaced entries 1, ..., ULP with random complex
*>         angles on the diagonal and random O(1) entries in the upper
*>         triangle.
*>
*>    (10) A matrix of the form  U' T U, where U is unitary and
*>         T has geometrically spaced entries 1, ..., ULP with random
*>         complex angles on the diagonal and random O(1) entries in
*>         the upper triangle.
*>
*>    (11) A matrix of the form  U' T U, where U is unitary and
*>         T has "clustered" entries 1, ULP,..., ULP with random
*>         complex angles on the diagonal and random O(1) entries in
*>         the upper triangle.
*>
*>    (12) A matrix of the form  U' T U, where U is unitary and
*>         T has complex eigenvalues randomly chosen from
*>         ULP < |z| < 1   and random O(1) entries in the upper
*>         triangle.
*>
*>    (13) A matrix of the form  X' T X, where X has condition
*>         SQRT( ULP ) and T has evenly spaced entries 1, ..., ULP
*>         with random complex angles on the diagonal and random O(1)
*>         entries in the upper triangle.
*>
*>    (14) A matrix of the form  X' T X, where X has condition
*>         SQRT( ULP ) and T has geometrically spaced entries
*>         1, ..., ULP with random complex angles on the diagonal
*>         and random O(1) entries in the upper triangle.
*>
*>    (15) A matrix of the form  X' T X, where X has condition
*>         SQRT( ULP ) and T has "clustered" entries 1, ULP,..., ULP
*>         with random complex angles on the diagonal and random O(1)
*>         entries in the upper triangle.
*>
*>    (16) A matrix of the form  X' T X, where X has condition
*>         SQRT( ULP ) and T has complex eigenvalues randomly chosen
*>         from ULP < |z| < 1 and random O(1) entries in the upper
*>         triangle.

*>         near the underflow threshold
*>
*>    (19) Nonsymmetric matrix with random entries chosen from |z| < 1

*>
*>    In addition, an input file will be read from logical unit number
*>    NIUNIT. The file contains matrices along with precomputed
*>    eigenvalues and reciprocal condition numbers for the eigenvalues
*>    and right eigenvectors. For these matrices, in addition to tests
*>    (1) to (9) we will compute the following two tests:
*>
*>   (10)  |RCONDV - RCDVIN| / cond(RCONDV)
*>
*>      RCONDV is the reciprocal right eigenvector condition number
*>      computed by CGEEVX and RCDVIN (the precomputed true value)
*>      is supplied as input. cond(RCONDV) is the condition number of
*>      RCONDV, and takes errors in computing RCONDV into account, so
*>      that the resulting quantity should be O(ULP). cond(RCONDV) is
*>      essentially given by norm(A)/RCONDE.
*>
*>   (11)  |RCONDE - RCDEIN| / cond(RCONDE)
*>
*>      RCONDE is the reciprocal eigenvalue condition number
*>      computed by CGEEVX and RCDEIN (the precomputed true value)
*>      is supplied as input.  cond(RCONDE) is the condition number
*>      of RCONDE, and takes errors in computing RCONDE into account,
*>      so that the resulting quantity should be O(ULP). cond(RCONDE)
*>      is essentially given by norm(A)/RCONDV.

*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] NSIZES
*> \verbatim
*>          NSIZES is INTEGER
*>          The number of sizes of matrices to use.  NSIZES must be at
*>          least zero. If it is zero, no randomly generated matrices
*>          are tested, but any test matrices read from NIUNIT will be
*>          tested.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NN
*> \verbatim
*>          NN is INTEGER array, dimension (NSIZES)
*>          An array containing the sizes to be used for the matrices.
*>          Zero values will be skipped.  The values must be at least
*>          zero.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NTYPES
*> \verbatim
*>          NTYPES is INTEGER
*>          The number of elements in DOTYPE. NTYPES must be at least
*>          zero. If it is zero, no randomly generated test matrices
*>          are tested, but and test matrices read from NIUNIT will be
*>          tested. If it is MAXTYP+1 and NSIZES is 1, then an
*>          additional type, MAXTYP+1 is defined, which is to use
*>          whatever matrix is in A.  This is only useful if
*>          DOTYPE(1:MAXTYP) is .FALSE. and DOTYPE(MAXTYP+1) is .TRUE. .
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] DOTYPE
*> \verbatim
*>          DOTYPE is LOGICAL array, dimension (NTYPES)
*>          If DOTYPE(j) is .TRUE., then for each size in NN a
*>          matrix of that size and of type j will be generated.
*>          If NTYPES is smaller than the maximum number of types
*>          defined (PARAMETER MAXTYP), then types NTYPES+1 through
*>          MAXTYP will not be generated.  If NTYPES is larger
*>          than MAXTYP, DOTYPE(MAXTYP+1) through DOTYPE(NTYPES)
*>          will be ignored.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in,out] ISEED
*> \verbatim
*>          ISEED is INTEGER array, dimension (4)
*>          On entry ISEED specifies the seed of the random number
*>          generator. The array elements should be between 0 and 4095;
*>          if not they will be reduced mod 4096.  Also, ISEED(4) must
*>          be odd.  The random number generator uses a linear
*>          congruential sequence limited to small integers, and so
*>          should produce machine independent random numbers. The
*>          values of ISEED are changed on exit, and can be used in the
*>          next call to CDRVVX to continue the same random number
*>          sequence.

*>
*> \param[in] THRESH
*> \verbatim
*>          THRESH is REAL
*>          A test will count as "failed" if the "error", computed as
*>          described above, exceeds THRESH.  Note that the error
*>          is scaled to be O(1), so THRESH should be a reasonably
*>          small multiple of 1, e.g., 10 or 100.  In particular,
*>          it should not depend on the precision (single vs. double)
*>          or the size of the matrix.  It must be at least zero.
