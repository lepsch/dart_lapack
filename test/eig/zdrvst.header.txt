*>
*>      ZDRVST  checks the Hermitian eigenvalue problem drivers.
*>
*>              ZHEEVD computes all eigenvalues and, optionally,
*>              eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian matrix,
*>              using a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
*>
*>              ZHEEVX computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally,
*>              eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian matrix.
*>
*>              ZHEEVR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally,
*>              eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian matrix
*>              using the Relatively Robust Representation where it can.
*>
*>              ZHPEVD computes all eigenvalues and, optionally,
*>              eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian matrix in packed
*>              storage, using a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
*>
*>              ZHPEVX computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally,
*>              eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian matrix in packed
*>              storage.
*>
*>              ZHBEVD computes all eigenvalues and, optionally,
*>              eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian band matrix,
*>              using a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
*>
*>              ZHBEVX computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally,
*>              eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian band matrix.
*>
*>              ZHEEV computes all eigenvalues and, optionally,
*>              eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian matrix.
*>
*>              ZHPEV computes all eigenvalues and, optionally,
*>              eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian matrix in packed
*>              storage.
*>
*>              ZHBEV computes all eigenvalues and, optionally,
*>              eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian band matrix.
*>
*>      When ZDRVST is called, a number of matrix "sizes" ("n's") and a
*>      number of matrix "types" are specified.  For each size ("n")
*>      and each type of matrix, one matrix will be generated and used
*>      to test the appropriate drivers.  For each matrix and each
*>      driver routine called, the following tests will be performed:
*>
*>      (1)     | A - Z D Z' | / ( |A| n ulp )
*>
*>      (2)     | I - Z Z' | / ( n ulp )
*>
*>      (3)     | D1 - D2 | / ( |D1| ulp )
*>
*>      where Z is the matrix of eigenvectors returned when the
*>      eigenvector option is given and D1 and D2 are the eigenvalues
*>      returned with and without the eigenvector option.
*>
*>      The "sizes" are specified by an array NN(1:NSIZES); the value of
*>      each element NN(j) specifies one size.
*>      The "types" are specified by a logical array DOTYPE( 1:NTYPES );
*>      if DOTYPE(j) is .TRUE., then matrix type "j" will be generated.
*>      Currently, the list of possible types is:
*>
*>      (1)  The zero matrix.
*>      (2)  The identity matrix.
*>
*>      (3)  A diagonal matrix with evenly spaced entries
*>           1, ..., ULP  and random signs.
*>           (ULP = (first number larger than 1) - 1 )
*>      (4)  A diagonal matrix with geometrically spaced entries
*>           1, ..., ULP  and random signs.
*>      (5)  A diagonal matrix with "clustered" entries 1, ULP, ..., ULP
*>           and random signs.
*>
*>      (6)  Same as (4), but multiplied by SQRT( overflow threshold )
*>      (7)  Same as (4), but multiplied by SQRT( underflow threshold )
*>
*>      (8)  A matrix of the form  U* D U, where U is unitary and
*>           D has evenly spaced entries 1, ..., ULP with random signs
*>           on the diagonal.
*>
*>      (9)  A matrix of the form  U* D U, where U is unitary and
*>           D has geometrically spaced entries 1, ..., ULP with random
*>           signs on the diagonal.
*>
*>      (10) A matrix of the form  U* D U, where U is unitary and
*>           D has "clustered" entries 1, ULP,..., ULP with random
*>           signs on the diagonal.
*>
*>      (11) Same as (8), but multiplied by SQRT( overflow threshold )
*>      (12) Same as (8), but multiplied by SQRT( underflow threshold )
*>
*>      (13) Symmetric matrix with random entries chosen from (-1,1).
*>      (14) Same as (13), but multiplied by SQRT( overflow threshold )
*>      (15) Same as (13), but multiplied by SQRT( underflow threshold )
*>      (16) A band matrix with half bandwidth randomly chosen between
*>           0 and N-1, with evenly spaced eigenvalues 1, ..., ULP
*>           with random signs.
*>      (17) Same as (16), but multiplied by SQRT( overflow threshold )
*>      (18) Same as (16), but multiplied by SQRT( underflow threshold )

*> \verbatim
*>  NSIZES  INTEGER
*>          The number of sizes of matrices to use.  If it is zero,
*>          ZDRVST does nothing.  It must be at least zero.
*>          Not modified.
*>
*>  NN      INTEGER array, dimension (NSIZES)
*>          An array containing the sizes to be used for the matrices.
*>          Zero values will be skipped.  The values must be at least
*>          zero.
*>          Not modified.
*>
*>  NTYPES  INTEGER
*>          The number of elements in DOTYPE.   If it is zero, ZDRVST
*>          does nothing.  It must be at least zero.  If it is MAXTYP+1
*>          and NSIZES is 1, then an additional type, MAXTYP+1 is
*>          defined, which is to use whatever matrix is in A.  This
*>          is only useful if DOTYPE(1:MAXTYP) is .FALSE. and
*>          DOTYPE(MAXTYP+1) is .TRUE. .
*>          Not modified.
*>
*>  DOTYPE  LOGICAL array, dimension (NTYPES)
*>          If DOTYPE(j) is .TRUE., then for each size in NN a
*>          matrix of that size and of type j will be generated.
*>          If NTYPES is smaller than the maximum number of types
*>          defined (PARAMETER MAXTYP), then types NTYPES+1 through
*>          MAXTYP will not be generated.  If NTYPES is larger
*>          than MAXTYP, DOTYPE(MAXTYP+1) through DOTYPE(NTYPES)
*>          will be ignored.
*>          Not modified.
*>
*>  ISEED   INTEGER array, dimension (4)
*>          On entry ISEED specifies the seed of the random number
*>          generator. The array elements should be between 0 and 4095;
*>          if not they will be reduced mod 4096.  Also, ISEED(4) must
*>          be odd.  The random number generator uses a linear
*>          congruential sequence limited to small integers, and so
*>          should produce machine independent random numbers. The
*>          values of ISEED are changed on exit, and can be used in the
*>          next call to ZDRVST to continue the same random number
*>          sequence.
*>          Modified.
*>
*>  THRESH  DOUBLE PRECISION
*>          A test will count as "failed" if the "error", computed as
*>          described above, exceeds THRESH.  Note that the error
*>          is scaled to be O(1), so THRESH should be a reasonably
*>          small multiple of 1, e.g., 10 or 100.  In particular,
*>          it should not depend on the precision (single vs. double)
*>          or the size of the matrix.  It must be at least zero.
*>          Not modified.
*>
*>  NOUNIT  INTEGER
*>          The FORTRAN unit number for printing out error messages
*>          (e.g., if a routine returns IINFO not equal to 0.)
*>          Not modified.
*>
*>  A       COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA , max(NN))
*>          Used to hold the matrix whose eigenvalues are to be
*>          computed.  On exit, A contains the last matrix actually
*>          used.
*>          Modified.
*>
*>  LDA     INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of A.  It must be at
*>          least 1 and at least max( NN ).
*>          Not modified.
*>
*>  D1      DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (max(NN))
*>          The eigenvalues of A, as computed by ZSTEQR simultaneously
*>          with Z.  On exit, the eigenvalues in D1 correspond with the
*>          matrix in A.
*>          Modified.
*>
*>  D2      DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (max(NN))
*>          The eigenvalues of A, as computed by ZSTEQR if Z is not
*>          computed.  On exit, the eigenvalues in D2 correspond with
*>          the matrix in A.
*>          Modified.
*>
*>  D3      DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (max(NN))
*>          The eigenvalues of A, as computed by DSTERF.  On exit, the
*>          eigenvalues in D3 correspond with the matrix in A.
*>          Modified.

*>          The leading dimension of U, Z, and V.  It must be at
*>          least 1 and at least max( NN ).
*>          Not modified.
*>
*>  V       COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDU, max(NN))
*>          The Housholder vectors computed by ZHETRD in reducing A to

*>
*>  TAU     COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (max(NN))
*>          The Householder factors computed by ZHETRD in reducing A

*>          Modified.
*>
*>  Z       COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDU, max(NN))
