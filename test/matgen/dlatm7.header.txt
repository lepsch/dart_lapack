*> \par Purpose:
*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*>    DLATM7 computes the entries of D as specified by MODE
*>    COND and IRSIGN. IDIST and ISEED determine the generation
*>    of random numbers. DLATM7 is called by DLATMT to generate
*>    random test matrices.

*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \verbatim
*>  MODE   - INTEGER
*>           On entry describes how D is to be computed:
*>           MODE = 0 means do not change D.
*>
*>           MODE = 1 sets D(1)=1 and D(2:RANK)=1.0/COND
*>           MODE = 2 sets D(1:RANK-1)=1 and D(RANK)=1.0/COND
*>           MODE = 3 sets D(I)=COND**(-(I-1)/(RANK-1)) I=1:RANK
*>
*>           MODE = 4 sets D(i)=1 - (i-1)/(N-1)*(1 - 1/COND)
*>           MODE = 5 sets D to random numbers in the range
*>                    ( 1/COND , 1 ) such that their logarithms
*>                    are uniformly distributed.
*>           MODE = 6 set D to random numbers from same distribution
*>                    as the rest of the matrix.
*>           MODE < 0 has the same meaning as ABS(MODE), except that
*>              the order of the elements of D is reversed.
*>           Thus if MODE is positive, D has entries ranging from
*>              1 to 1/COND, if negative, from 1/COND to 1,
*>           Not modified.
*>
*>  COND   - DOUBLE PRECISION
*>           On entry, used as described under MODE above.
*>           If used, it must be >= 1. Not modified.
*>
*>  IRSIGN - INTEGER
*>           On entry, if MODE neither -6, 0 nor 6, determines sign of
*>           entries of D
*>           0 => leave entries of D unchanged
*>           1 => multiply each entry of D by 1 or -1 with probability .5
*>
*>  IDIST  - CHARACTER*1
*>           On entry, IDIST specifies the type of distribution to be
*>           used to generate a random matrix .
*>           1 => UNIFORM( 0, 1 )
*>           2 => UNIFORM( -1, 1 )
*>           3 => NORMAL( 0, 1 )
*>           Not modified.
*>
*>  ISEED  - INTEGER array, dimension ( 4 )
*>           On entry ISEED specifies the seed of the random number
*>           generator. The random number generator uses a
*>           linear congruential sequence limited to small
*>           integers, and so should produce machine independent
*>           random numbers. The values of ISEED are changed on
*>           exit, and can be used in the next call to DLATM7
*>           to continue the same random number sequence.
*>           Changed on exit.
*>
*>  D      - DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( MIN( M , N ) )
*>           Array to be computed according to MODE, COND and IRSIGN.
*>           May be changed on exit if MODE is nonzero.
*>
*>  N      - INTEGER
*>           Number of entries of D. Not modified.
*>
*>  RANK   - INTEGER
*>           The rank of matrix to be generated for modes 1,2,3 only.
*>           D( RANK+1:N ) = 0.
*>           Not modified.
*>
*>  INFO   - INTEGER
*>            0  => normal termination
*>           -1  => if MODE not in range -6 to 6
*>           -2  => if MODE neither -6, 0 nor 6, and
*>                  IRSIGN neither 0 nor 1
*>           -3  => if MODE neither -6, 0 nor 6 and COND less than 1
*>           -4  => if MODE equals 6 or -6 and IDIST not in range 1 to 3
*>           -7  => if N negative
