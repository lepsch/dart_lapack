*  =============
*>
*> \verbatim
*>
*> ZLAVSY_ROOK performs one of the matrix-vector operations
*>    x := A*x  or  x := A'*x,
*> where x is an N element vector and  A is one of the factors
*> from the block U*D*U' or L*D*L' factorization computed by ZSYTRF_ROOK.
*>
*> If TRANS = 'N', multiplies by U  or U * D  (or L  or L * D)
*> If TRANS = 'T', multiplies by U' or D * U' (or L' or D * L')
*> \endverbatim
*
*  Arguments:
*  ==========
*
*> \param[in] UPLO
*> \verbatim
*>          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
*>          Specifies whether the factor stored in A is upper or lower
*>          triangular.
*>          = 'U':  Upper triangular
*>          = 'L':  Lower triangular
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] TRANS
*> \verbatim
*>          TRANS is CHARACTER*1
*>          Specifies the operation to be performed:
*>          = 'N':  x := A*x
*>          = 'T':  x := A'*x
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] DIAG
*> \verbatim
*>          DIAG is CHARACTER*1
*>          Specifies whether or not the diagonal blocks are unit
*>          matrices.  If the diagonal blocks are assumed to be unit,
*>          then A = U or A = L, otherwise A = U*D or A = L*D.
*>          = 'U':  Diagonal blocks are assumed to be unit matrices.
*>          = 'N':  Diagonal blocks are assumed to be non-unit matrices.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] N
*> \verbatim
*>          N is INTEGER
*>          The number of rows and columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] NRHS
*> \verbatim
*>          NRHS is INTEGER
*>          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of vectors
*>          x to be multiplied by A.  NRHS >= 0.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] A
*> \verbatim
*>          A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
*>          The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
*>          obtain the factor U or L as computed by ZSYTRF_ROOK.
*>          Stored as a 2-D triangular matrix.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDA
*> \verbatim
*>          LDA is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] IPIV
*> \verbatim
*>          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*>          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D,
*>          as determined by ZSYTRF_ROOK.
*>
*>          If UPLO = 'U':
*>               If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k)
*>               were interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*>               (If IPIV( k ) = k, no interchange was done).
*>
*>               If IPIV(k) < 0 and IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
*>               columns k and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and rows and
*>               columns k-1 and -IPIV(k-1) were inerchaged,
*>               D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.
*>
*>          If UPLO = 'L':
*>               If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k)
*>               were interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
*>               (If IPIV( k ) = k, no interchange was done).
*>
*>               If IPIV(k) < 0 and IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and
*>               columns k and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and rows and
*>               columns k+1 and -IPIV(k+1) were inerchaged,
*>               D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

*>
*> \param[in,out] B
*> \verbatim
*>          B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
*>          On entry, B contains NRHS vectors of length N.
*>          On exit, B is overwritten with the product A * B.
*> \endverbatim
*>
*> \param[in] LDB
*> \verbatim
*>          LDB is INTEGER
*>          The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

*> \verbatim
*>          INFO is INTEGER
